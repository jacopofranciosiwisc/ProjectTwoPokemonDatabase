FrontEndDeveloper README for Project Two (CS400 @ UW Madison)
========================================================

Name of FrontEndDeveloper: Rohan Putcha
@wisc.edu Email of FrontEndDeveloper: rputcha@wisc.edu
Group: JC
Team: red

Files Written by Me:
--------------------
<List all files that were within this project that were written by you, and
 include a short description of the purpose that each file servers>

Frontend.java: 
This file serves as the location where the program is directly run (through the main method). It puts together all the code of the other programmers in an understandable way for the user to interact with the application. It provides commands and works with the user to make use of the application.

FrontEndDeveloperTests.java:
This file serves as the test suite for the Frontend.java file. It ensures that the commands work as intended and messages are output to the user correctly. It uses JUnit5 to accomplish this.

RedBlackTree.java:
This code was partially written by me and partially by the course staff. I mention this in the header comment for the RBT file as well. It serves as the data structure that the backend uses to make this application functional. It stores Pokemon arranged by CP so that they can be accessed efficiently.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
<List any additional contributions that you have made toward your team's
 completion of this project.  This might include, but is not limited to things
 like: organizing team communication, creating extra tests or dummy classes,
 assisting team members in any way, etc.>

I created a Backend dummy class so that I can begin working on my frontend implementation immediately. I also assisted in implementing parts of the backend class.

Signature:

Exception: Some of the RedBlackTree.java file was coded by the course staff. I only implemented the "red-black" aspect of it.
