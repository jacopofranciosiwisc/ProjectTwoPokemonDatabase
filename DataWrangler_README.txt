Files Written by Me:
--------------------
1. PokemonInterface.java - Interface used to create a Pokemon object. It allowed other team members to write their code before Pokemon.java was available
2. Pokemon.java - Class to write a Pokemon object. The RBTree is populated by nodes that have these objects
3. DataReaderInterface.java - Interface used to create a DataReader object.
4. DataReader.java - Class that has 1 method (readDataSet) to extract the contents of the pokemon_stats.csv file. The Backend class calls this method to receive the list of all Pokemon objects.
5. DataWranglerTests.java - JUnit 5 test class to test the functionality of the methods within the Pokemon.java class (and readDataSet()).



Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
I participated in team meetings and contributed by sharing implementation thoughts and ideas. I always assissted my team members with any questions or concerns they had regarding their code. Specifically,
 I helped the Backend Developer of our team in implementing one of his methods. Overall, I believe I fulfilled my role as a Data Wrangler and as a teammate.
